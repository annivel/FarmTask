# FarmTask
The main goal of this task is the implementation of the Farm image with the animals: Dog and Sheep. 

This project is implemented such as technologies as:

  - Java
  - Maven
  - TesNG

The structure of the Farm we can imagine as two Rectangle. There are two objects: the farm and inside the farm, we have the fence.
 - The sheep has the access to all objects like the fence square and the farm square. 
 - The dog has the access to the Farm but doesn't have the access to the fence square.


So what we will get if we call the method "move" for the dog with the fence square coordinates? 

Check it out in my repository!

In addition, I've created a UNIT tests, so you can find it at the "TestSuits" class


and also I've implemented test cases for this project
